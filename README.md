## About Me

Hi, I'm Sora Morimoto. I'm currently living at the intersection of industry and
academia, working on computer systems and programming language platforms in
multidisciplinary teams. My primary focus lies within functional programming
languages such as OCaml. Nevertheless, I'm not cynical about other programming
languages and paradigms, even though my preference leans towards formalisable
aspects rather than subjective appeals to taste or intuition.
